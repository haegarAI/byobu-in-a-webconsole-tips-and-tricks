byobu in a webconsole tips and tricks

Working remotly via Citrix on a Windows Desktop in german and then in a browser like Google Chrome in a ssh console session with a germann keyboard can bring a lot of troubles with the keymappings...

So for instance Ctrl-F2 is already mapped in Citrix to be able to switch back to your local session instead of splitting/ openening a new pane in your byobu session...

Or if you haven' yet activated your mouse you have to press Alt-F12 to turn mouse mode on, which is really helpful when resizing split panes in a window.
Pressing it mutliple times turns it off and on again and again ;) 

I spent now already some time with that topic and I didn't find some real single point of answers to my questions, and therefore I decided to add this collection, hoping that it will help others struggling also with the great keybindings in byobu, because of reasons ....

Feel free to add your findings as well, Thank you!
