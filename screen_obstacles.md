So when starting byobu "screen" is used in the background, a real great tool for working with a text console in a cool, modern way: but it needs a bit of practice ;)

First and foremost the most important info is, that you switch into the "screen" command mode usualy per default with Ctrl-a
In byobu this is mapped to F12 per default...So whenever you press F12 in byobu, you are actibating the "screen" command mode: 
here you can for instance paste the "screen" clipboard with Ctr-] ... which means on a german keyboard pressing AltGr-9 and is not so comfortable as you can imagine:

But you can change this to the today more convenient keybindinbg/kemapping Ctrl-c (german keyborad Strg-c): really Ctrl-c? yes indeed this works and doesn't stop kill a process as you are in the "screen" command mode which you activated by pressing F12 in your byobu session!
