As I had problems creating a new vertical pane in my byobu session with Ctrl-F2 I needed to change this setting to another keybinding.

So therefore I changed/edited the file ".byobu/keybindings.tmux"
~~~
$  cat .byobu/keybindings.tmux
bind-key -n C-O display-panes \; split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind-key -n C-B display-panes \; split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"
...
~~~
here you can see that I mapped C-O = Ctrl-o (german keyboard Strg-o) to create horizontal pane
and C-B = Ctrl-b (german keyboard Strg-b) to create vertical pane

The syntax in tmux is slightly different than in screenrc, where they use lower and uppercase letters,
whereas in tmux they always add an S to have an uppercase letters: like C-S-B = Ctrl-Shift-b
